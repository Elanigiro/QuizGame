# QuizGame

This is a Spring Boot Java web application.
The backend is based on a SQL embedded DBMS (Apache Derby) managed through JPA and Hibernate ORM.
The frontend scripts are transpiled in Javascript from the original source in Dart.
The structure and presentation layers are written in pure HTML5 and CSS3.
The application is made responsive through the use of CSS media query and breakpoints.

Some external resources are embedded to improve the presentation and functionality: Normalize.css, SimpleBar, Google Fonts, LogBack.
